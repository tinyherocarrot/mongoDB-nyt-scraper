## App Functionalities
1. Scrape latest articles from _The Atlantic_ homepage

## Tools and Technologies
To build the front end I used HTML5, CSS3, the framework [Bulma.io](https://bulma.io/), and JavaScript/jQuery. 
In the back end, I used MongoDB/Mongoose for the database, and Node, Express, and Handlebars for server/middleware.

## To-do
